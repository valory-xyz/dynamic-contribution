### Security issues. Updated 01-12-22
#### Problems found instrumentally
Several checks are obtained automatically. They are commented. No issue found by instrumentally way <br>
[slither-full](https://github.com/valory-xyz/dynamic-contribution/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/slither_full.txt) <br>


#### DynamicContribution needs attention
In my opinion, the problems have a medium/low level of risk and they are related to the fact that the contract includes burn(). <br>
The contract requires improvement or exclusion of the functionality with the burning of tokens. <br>

##### totalSupply incorrect with `burn()`. Medium priority
```
// Unit counter
uint256 public totalSupply;

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721
    /// @notice Count NFTs tracked by this contract
    /// @return A count of valid NFTs tracked by this contract, where each one of
    ///  them has an assigned and queryable owner not equal to the zero address
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);

This condition will not be met in the current version of the contract after each operation `burn`
```

##### tokenURI without checking by EIP-721. Medium priority 
```
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md
/// @dev Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT. URIs are defined in RFC

    function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view virtual override returns (string memory) {
        return string.concat(baseURI, tokenId.toString());
    }
no existence check of tokenId
```

##### exists incorrect with `burn()`. Medium priority

```
    function exists(uint256 tokenId) public view virtual returns (bool) {
        return tokenId > 0 && tokenId < (totalSupply + 1);
    }
correct like 
        return _ownerOf(tokenId) != address(0);
```

##### tokenByIndex needs to be rechecked for implementation with `burn()`. Medium priority

##### tokenOfOwnerByIndex not implemented. Low priority/No issue
```
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md
The enumeration extension is OPTIONAL for ERC-721 smart contracts (see "caveats", below). This allows your contract to publish its full list of NFTs and make them discoverable.

tokenOfOwnerByIndex not implemented from this list
```

##### Remove virtual in DynamicContribution. Low priority.
Ref: https://medium.com/upstate-interactive/solidity-override-vs-virtual-functions-c0a5dfb83aaf
A function that allows an inheriting contract to override its behavior will be marked at virtual. (c)
